# Security model

## Security model

Policies are set per sandbox in the dashboard or through the API.

| Control | How it is enforced |
| --- | --- |
| Tool permissions (`shell.exec`, `screen.read`, `input.control`, `files.read`, `files.write`) | Checked by the API before every tool call. A denied call returns 403. |
| Network policy (default allow/deny, DNS on/off, domain, IP and CIDR rules) | On the host, outside the sandbox: one `zoo-egress` container per Docker host runs nftables rules for each sandbox, a proxy that decides HTTP and TLS by Host header and server name (so domain rules hold when IPs change), and a DNS resolver that only answers allowed names. Sandboxes have no `NET_ADMIN` or raw sockets, so even root inside can't change or get around it. Stopping the daemon leaves its rules in place, so traffic fails closed. |
| App policy | A root service in the sandbox (`zoo-guest -apps`) reads the policy from a root-only file, makes denied programs root-only and kills running copies. |
| Secrets | Envelope encryption: each workspace has its own data key, wrapped by `ZOO_SECRETS_KEY` or an external KMS (`ZOO_KMS`: AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS or Vault transit). Injected as environment variables when the sandbox starts. |
| Kernel | Kata Containers puts each sandbox in its own VM. On the runc fallback, sandboxes get a tighter seccomp filter and, on AppArmor hosts, the `zoo-sandbox` profile (`deploy/security/`). |
| Live view | The dashboard opens the VNC websocket with a single-use ticket that expires after 30 seconds (`POST /sandboxes/{id}/vnc-ticket`), never the session token. x11vnc listens only inside the sandbox and has a per-sandbox password that only the API holds; the API logs in with it and offers the browser no auth. |
| Rate limits | `/auth/login`: 20 a minute per IP and 10 a minute per email. `/auth/signup`: 10 an hour per IP. Each API key: 600 requests a minute. Over the limit returns 429 with `Retry-After`. Counts are kept in memory, per API process. |
| Audit | Every tool call is stored with its input, output and status, and shown in the Activity tab. |

Policy changes apply immediately to a running sandbox and are applied again on every start. Secret changes apply on the next start.
