"""A persistent queue for sandbox lifecycle work (boot, stop, delete, move).

Jobs live in the `jobs` table, so a restart resumes them instead of losing them. Each job retries with backoff up to
its attempt limit and fails for good once it runs out of attempts or passes its deadline. Work for one sandbox runs one
job at a time, and handlers are written to be safe to run again.
